Parts of our city have experienced significant economic growth in the last several years. Yet, for our community to truly succeed, everyone must succeed. That’s why High Point is redeveloping and reinvesting in Washington Street now as a down payment toward that future.</p></div> <div class="image-mid-width"><img src="/eddit/high-point/high-point-ref-map.png" alt="Your Image"> <p class="caption"><b>Location of Washington Street in High Point, NC.</b></p></div> <div class="text"><h2>Building on the rich history and existing strengths of Washington Street</h2> <p>Washington Street has a unique and rich history in High Point.</p> <p>Shortly after the City of High Point was incorporated in the mid 1800s, Washington Street took shape as a cultural and economic hub, and a vibrant Main Street for High Point’s African American community - sometimes referred to as High Point’s “Black Wall Street”. The corridor boasted 18 black-owned businesses by 1910, and just over 50 by 1940, most of which were concentrated along a few blocks. Establishments along Washington Street included hotels, law and real estate offices, dentists, pharmacists, entertainment venues, meeting spaces, as well as several churches. Even in the face of the inequalities of the past, Washington Street was a vibrant center for African American community and business in High Point.</p> <p>Today, Washington Street remains a deeply valuable place in High Point. 
			Although this corridor and the surrounding area faced various hurdles in the second half of the 20th century, including disruptive highway construction, the closure of a key educational institution, and broader disinvestment that occurred as integration took place in the late 1960s and 1970s, it represents to this day an essential part of High Point’s story. 
			Thanks to active efforts by community members, Washington Street was also officially recognized as a National Historic place in 2010.</p></div> <div class="image-mid-width"><svelte-css-wrapper style="display: contents; --handle-size: 3rem; --slider-color: white; --slider-width: 0.17rem;"><div class="svelte-compare-image-container svelte-qgpj5s" style="--container-height: 0px; --container-width: 0px; --slider-position: 0.5;" data-testid="svelte-compare-image"><img src="/eddit/high-point/imagery-1958.png" alt="left" class="left-img svelte-qgpj5s"> <img src="/eddit/high-point/imagery-today.png" alt="right" class="right-img svelte-qgpj5s"> <div class="slider svelte-qgpj5s" role="slider" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="1" aria-valuenow="0.5" aria-label="Compare image" tabindex="0"><div class="line svelte-qgpj5s"></div> <div class="handle svelte-qgpj5s"></div> <div class="line svelte-qgpj5s"></div></div></div><!----></svelte-css-wrapper> <p class="caption"><b>Aerial view of Washington Street in 1958 and 2023</b> / Source: City

			Given this strategic location, there is great potential for Washington Street and its surrounding neighborhood to be part of this ongoing revitalization.</p> <h3>Downtown High Point:</h3> <p>Downtown’s revitalization has been underway thanks to private and public reinvestment, with the City’s goal being to draw both residents and visitors all year round. 
			Two main projects helped catalyze this transformation: one is the Truist Point Stadium, which opened in 2019 and is home to the Rockers baseball team and the Carolina Core FC soccer team, and the other is Congdon Yards, an adaptive reuse of two former mill buildings that are now home to a an innovative design and business center. Congdon Yards offers a mix of offices, meeting rooms, coworking space, small-scale manufacturing/woodworking space, a café and restaurant, and other event spaces.
			These projects are the result of a highly collaborative effort between the local city government and multiple business and community leaders. 
			Other businesses have opened in the area since then, such as Plank Street Tavern and Stock + Grain Food Hall.</p> <div class="image-mid-width"><img src="/eddit/high-point/img-congdon-yards.png" alt="Your Image"> <p class="caption">Image Source: www.congdonyards.com</p></div> <h3>High Point University:</h3> <p>High Point University has grown exponentially since 2005, under the leadership of the current president, Dr. Qubein. The campus has grown from about 90 acres and 1,500 students in the 1990s, to over 400 acres and over 5,000 students today, including new amenities that serve the campus and the community, such as a new arena and conference center.</p></div> <div class="text"><h2>Building on existing visitor activity in High Point</h2> <p>In addition to new projects and developments, another way to understand existing economic development momentum in High Point is to look at the amount of human activity occurring in different parts of the city. This can help us get a sense of where residents and visitors are going to shop, to eat, to work, or to play, and therefore understand where High Point’s existing hubs of activity are located today. One way to track this type of activity is using cell phone data.</p> <p>As an example, the map below shows the number of daily visitors in the areas surrounding Washington Street. The concentration of activity around Downtown and High Point University shows the potential for Washington Street to attract more residents and visitors, thereby ensuring that we promote vibrant, economic opportunities for all of our neighborhoods.</p></div> <div class="map"><div id="map-wrapper" class="svelte-pd3ixg"><div id="map-title" class="svelte-pd3ixg"><h3 class="svelte-pd3ixg">High Point Visits Per Day</h3> <div id="legend" class="svelte-pd3ixg"><svg width="300" height="40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><rect x="0" y="0" width="75" height="15" fill="#e8f7f4" class="svelte-pd3ixg"></rect><rect x="75" y="0" width="75" height="15" fill="#99dacf" class="svelte-pd3ixg"></rect><rect x="150" y="0" width="75" height="15" fill="#3bb7a3" class="svelte-pd3ixg"></rect><rect x="225" y="0" width="75" height="15" fill="#007663" class="svelte-pd3ixg"></rect><text class="legend-label svelte-pd3ixg" x="75" y="32" text-anchor="middle">500</text><text class="legend-label svelte-pd3ixg" x="150" y="32" text-anchor="middle">2,500</text><text class="legend-label svelte-pd3ixg" x="225" y="32" text-anchor="middle">5,000</text></svg></div></div> <div id="cellular-map" class="svelte-pd3ixg"><div class="map-zoom-wrapper svelte-pd3ixg"><div class="map-zoom svelte-pd3ixg"><svg width="24" height="24"><line x1="5" y1="13" x2="19" y2="13" stroke="#4d4d4d" stroke-width="4"></line><line x1="12" y1="6" x2="12" y2="20" stroke="#4d4d4d" stroke-width="4"></line></svg></div> <div class="map-zoom svelte-pd3ixg"><svg width="24" height="24"><line x1="5" y1="13" x2="19" y2="13" stroke="#4d4d4d" stroke-width="4"></line></svg></div></div></div></div><!----> <p class="caption">Mobility Data Source: Spectus</p></div> <div class="text"><h2>Utilizing the strengths of local entrepreneurs to reinvest in Washington Street</h2> <p>Our community has already invested deeply in local entrepreneurs and innovators through the Thrive High Point program, which began in 2021 and is run by the City’s Chamber of Commerce.
